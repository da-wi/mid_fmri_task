# Monetary incentive delay task 

![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/da-wi/mid_fmri_task/master/instruction/mid_fmri_task.png)

## Installation

Requirements
- Installation of python 2.7 or higher
- Installation of pygame
- Setting the paths correctly on your system

Here is a step by step tutorial on how to install pygame:
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

## Quick start

After installation of the requirements, you should be able to launch the task via the commandline:

1. Change to the correct folder (e.g. "cd /this/is/the/correct/path")
2. Call the mid_task_v5.py3 script

```
python mid_task_v5.py3 SUBJECTID -s single -o -t 1
```

"SUBJECTID" is mandatory for the logfile
"-s single" enforces window mode - in the script this must be manually adjusted according to the local setup - right now this is adjusted for the MR centre in Zurich.
"-o" omits color in the symbols
"-t 1" sets the shape type balancing to balancing "1" (out of 6 possible balancings, see instructions)

3. Start the task by pressing "t"
4. Press the button "b" whenever you see the target (star symbol)
